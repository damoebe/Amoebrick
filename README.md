# Amoebrick API
Amoebrick is an API with the purpose to convert Images to an adjustable Brick-Mosaic. It is able to display the needed parts for the build and generate a preview image as well as a cost and size estimate. This is all done by utilizing a slightly modified version of the [Rebrickable Catalog Database](https://rebrickable.com/downloads/) as csv files.
The bricks used to build the mosaic all have the same part number (3005) and size (1x1) but differend element-ids. All bricks needed to build the image can be found on sites like [Bricklink](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/main.page).
## How to use The API?
Amoebrick has not been published to Maven-Central jet, so you will need to manually download the .jar from this page and save it in your project-folder.
